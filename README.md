📊 Data Professions Dashboard – Power BI Project

This project focuses on analyzing trends and insights in data-related professions using Power BI. The goal was to explore how different job roles within the data industry—such as Data Analysts, Data Scientists, and Data Engineers—compare in terms of salary, demand, region, and required technical skills. The dataset used for this analysis (Power BI - Final Project.xlsx) was cleaned, modeled, and visualized using Power BI Desktop to create an interactive and meaningful dashboard.

I began by connecting the Excel dataset to Power BI and preparing the data for analysis through cleaning and transformation. Once the data was structured, I created several calculated measures using DAX to derive key insights such as average salary, skill frequency, and country-wise job distribution. The visuals were then designed to help users easily understand which data roles are most in demand and which regions and skill sets dominate the field.

The final dashboard provides a clear overview of the data profession landscape. It highlights that Data Scientists tend to have the highest average salaries, while roles like Data Analyst and Data Engineer show steady growth across countries. The United States and the United Kingdom emerge as leading regions for data-related opportunities. Across all roles, Python, SQL, and Power BI stand out as the most in-demand technical skills, reaffirming their importance in the data industry.

This project demonstrates how Power BI can be used for career and industry analysis by turning raw data into interactive and visually rich insights. It also strengthened my understanding of data modeling, relationship management, and visualization best practices.
